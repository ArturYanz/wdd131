            <h2>Ether 12:27</h2>
            <p>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my
            grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have
            faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</p>

            <h2>Moroni 10:4</h2>
            <p>And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of
            Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in
            Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost.</p>
